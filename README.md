# Bun Bun Bake Shop
*PUI Homework 5 by Gautham Sajith*

This is a React website for a fictional bakery based in Pittsburgh, PA.

The site is live at [https://gsajith.com/bunbun/](https://gsajith.com/bunbun/)!

**However**, it is best viewed by cloning the repo and running `npm start` in the project directory. This will start the app at [http://localhost:3000/bunbun/](http://localhost:3000/bunbun/) in your browser.

Features:
 - Home page (/bunbun)
 - Product browsing page (/bunbun/shop)
 - Product details page (Modal when clicking on a product card)
	 - **Bonus** product details are built for every item
 - **Bonus** About page (/bunbun/about) 
 - **Bonus** Catering page (/bunbun/catering) 
 - **Bonus** "Added to cart" snackbar when item is added to your cart

The interesting source code lives under `src/component`.
